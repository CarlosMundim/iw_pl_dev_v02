# ONBOARDING GUIDE

## For Developers

### Getting Started
1. **Access**: Request GitHub repo access from [contact@iworkz.ai](mailto:contact@iworkz.ai). All code and infra is managed via GitHub.
2. **Setup**: Install Docker Desktop, Node.js (LTS), Python 3.10+, and VS Code. Clone repo, run `docker compose up`, access `localhost:3000`.
3. **Dev Workflow**: All feature/bug branches must use pull requests and code review.
4. **Secrets**: Local `.env` files are never committedâ€”request encrypted credentials from the ops lead.
5. **Issue Tracking**: We use GitHub Issues for all tasks, bugs, and enhancements.

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Prerequisites check
node --version    # Should be 18+
python --version  # Should be 3.10+
docker --version  # Should be 20.10+

# Clone and setup
git clone git@github.com:your-org/iworkz-platform.git
cd iworkz-platform

# Environment configuration
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your local configuration

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:3000  # Web frontend
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Backend API
```

### Code Quality Standards
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
- **Formatting**: Prettier with consistent configuration
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Security**: Regular security audits and dependency updates

### Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes with descriptive commits
3. Run tests and quality checks locally
4. Push branch and create pull request
5. Address code review feedback
6. Merge after approval and CI passes

## For Partners

### Integration Process
- **Integrations**: Start with the [Integration Hub](../2_SERVICES/integration-hub/README.md).
- **APIs**: See API documentation for endpoint specifications and authentication
- **Security**: Refer to [GDPR Compliance](../5_SECURITY/GDPR_COMPLIANCE.md) and [Security Protocols](../5_SECURITY/SECURITY_PROTOCOLS.md).
- **Testing**: Sandbox environment available for integration testing

### Partner Onboarding Steps
1. **Initial Contact**: Reach out to partnerships team
2. **Technical Assessment**: Review integration requirements
3. **Sandbox Access**: Receive development environment credentials
4. **Integration Development**: Build and test integration
5. **Security Review**: Complete security and compliance review
6. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment
7. **Ongoing Support**: Access to technical support and documentation
