## üìà Market Opportunity

- **$500B+ global labour mobility market**: Key sectors such as healthcare, infrastructure, energy, and technology face critical, long-term shortages.
- **East Asia‚Äôs urgency**: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are world leaders in both ageing populations and skilled labour gaps.
- **OECD forecast**: A worldwide deficit of **18M+ healthcare and technical professionals by 2030**  
  [OECD Employment Outlook 2023](https://www.oecd.org/employment/Outlook-2023.pdf)
- **Policy tailwinds**: From Japan‚Äôs Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) reforms to Singapore‚Äôs sectoral transformation drives, momentum for change is accelerating.

---

## üí• The Problem

- **Cross-border hiring is broken**: Legal, regulatory, and credentialling complexity causes long delays and risk in high-stakes sectors.
- **Foreign workers lack support**: Language barriers, opaque processes, and poor wellbeing drive churn and underperformance.
- **Japan-specific vendor gaps**: Traditional giants (e.g., TechnoPro) dominate but lack flexibility, AI integration, or SME-centric offerings.
- **SMEs underserved**: Small and medium Japanese enterprises cannot access affordable, localised AI tools or tailored international talent solutions.
