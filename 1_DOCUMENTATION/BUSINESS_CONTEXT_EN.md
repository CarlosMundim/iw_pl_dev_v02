---

## Market Opportunity

- **$500B+ global labour mobility market:** High-value segments (healthcare, engineering, energy, construction, IT) face chronic shortages and surging cross-border demand.
- **Ageing populations:** OECD countries forecast a shortfall of 18M+ healthcare and technical workers by 2030【https://www.oecd.org/employment/Outlook-2023.pdf】.
- **Compliance and ESG pressures:** New legislation and consumer scrutiny require smarter, transparent, AI-powered solutions to protect both workers and employers.
- **Incumbent platforms are failing:** Fragmented, manual, or country-specific players (e.g. traditional recruiters, generic job boards) cannot meet global compliance, quality, and speed expectations.

---

## Problem We Solve

- **Complexity and risk:** Global hiring is slowed by legal, regulatory, and compliance hurdles—especially in healthcare, technical and EPC (Engineering, Procurement & Construction) roles.
- **Poor candidate experience:** Foreign workers face fragmented support, low transparency, and limited upskilling.
- **Legacy solutions lag behind:** Traditional staffing and recruitment models are not designed for modern, AI-driven, borderless hiring.

## Why Now?

- **Labour shortages are hitting crisis point** across the world’s largest economies, especially in healthcare, energy, infrastructure, and STEM.
- **Regulatory and consumer scrutiny** is rising—compliance and ESG are non-negotiable for global employers.
- **AI and automation** now enable what was impossible five years ago: compliant, borderless, real-time hiring and workforce management.
