# Audit Logging

## Purpose
Full transparency and traceability for all actions affecting sensitive data or compliance-critical workflows, ensuring accountability and supporting regulatory compliance requirements.

## What is Logged

### User Activities
- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, logout, password changes, MFA events
- **Authorization Changes**: Permission grants, role modifications, access level changes
- **Data Access**: Read operations on sensitive data (PII, financial, compliance)
- **Data Modifications**: Create, update, delete operations with before/after values
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, deletion of documents and attachments
- **Session Management**: Session creation, timeout, termination, concurrent sessions

### System Activities
- **Configuration Changes**: System settings, security configurations, feature toggles
- **Integration Events**: API calls to/from third-party services with sanitized payloads
- **Compliance Actions**: Regulatory checks, validation results, approval workflows
- **Security Events**: Failed access attempts, privilege escalations, anomaly detection
- **Data Processing**: AI/ML model runs, automated matching, batch processing jobs
- **Backup Operations**: Backup creation, restoration, integrity checks

### Administrative Actions
- **User Management**: Account creation, deactivation, privilege changes, password resets
- **System Maintenance**: Deployments, updates, maintenance windows, emergency changes
- **Policy Updates**: Changes to security policies, compliance rules, business logic
- **Incident Response**: Security incidents, investigation actions, remediation steps
- **Compliance Reviews**: Audit activities, certification events, regulatory submissions

## Log Format and Structure

### Standard Log Fields

  "event_id": "uuid-v4-unique-identifier",
  "user_id": "user-identifier-or-system",
  "session_id": "session-identifier",
  "ip_address": "source-ip-address",
  "user_agent": "client-user-agent",
  "event_type": "category.subcategory.action",
  "resource_type": "data-type-affected",
  "resource_id": "specific-resource-identifier",
  "action": "specific-action-performed",
  "outcome": "success|failure|partial",

}
```

### Sensitive Data Handling
- **Data Masking**: PII and sensitive data masked or redacted in logs
- **Tokenization**: Sensitive identifiers replaced with non-reversible tokens
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent format for automated parsing and analysis
- **Integrity Protection**: Cryptographic signatures to prevent log tampering
- **Separation**: Sensitive audit logs stored separately from application logs

## Retention & Storage

### Retention Policies
- **Security Logs**: 7 years minimum retention for all security-related events
- **Compliance Logs**: Retention aligned with regulatory requirements (up to 10 years)
- **Operational Logs**: 2 years for general application and system logs
- **Backup Logs**: Long-term archival with periodic integrity verification
- **Legal Hold**: Extended retention during litigation or regulatory investigations

### Storage Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: High-performance, searchable log storage for recent events
- **Archive Storage**: Cost-effective long-term storage for historical logs
- **Geographic Distribution**: Logs replicated across multiple regions
- **Encryption**: All logs encrypted at rest with separate key management
- **Access Controls**: Strict RBAC for log access with approval workflows

### Data Integrity
- **Immutable Logs**: Write-once, read-many storage to prevent tampering
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Hash chains to verify log sequence integrity
- **Digital Signatures**: Signed log entries for non-repudiation
- **Regular Verification**: Automated integrity checks and anomaly detection
- **Chain of Custody**: Documented handling procedures for forensic evidence

## Access Control and Monitoring

### Role-Based Access
- **Security Team**: Full access to security and incident-related logs
- **Compliance Team**: Access to regulatory and compliance audit logs
- **Development Team**: Limited access to application logs for debugging
- **Auditors**: Read-only access to specific log categories during audits
- **Data Subjects**: Access to logs containing their personal data (GDPR)

### Access Monitoring
- **Log Access Logging**: All log access activities are themselves logged
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-person authorization for sensitive log access
- **Time-Limited Access**: Temporary access grants with automatic expiration
- **Purpose Justification**: Required business justification for all log access
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic review of log access permissions and activities

### Query and Analysis
- **Search Capabilities**: Full-text search across all log categories
- **Filtering and Aggregation**: Advanced filtering by time, user, event type
- **Correlation Analysis**: Cross-reference events across different systems
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical trend analysis and pattern recognition
- **Export Functions**: Secure export for legal and compliance purposes
