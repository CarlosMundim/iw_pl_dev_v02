# Security Protocols

## Overview
iWORKZ follows security-by-design principles, with strict controls across all layers to protect user data, maintain system integrity, and ensure compliance with global security standards.

## Core Security Measures

### Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: All data encrypted using AES-256 encryption with managed keys
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications, with HSTS enabled
- **End-to-End**: Sensitive communications encrypted between client and server
- **Database**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for all database storage
- **Backups**: Encrypted backups with separate key management system

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all user and admin accounts
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Integration with enterprise identity providers
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions based on job functions
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiration and refresh mechanisms
- **Privileged Access**: Additional security controls for administrative access

### Network Security
- **Firewall Protection**: Web Application Firewall (WAF) with DDoS protection
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolation of critical systems and databases
- **VPN Access**: Secure remote access for administrative functions
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and automated attacks
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restricted access for sensitive operations

## Application Security

### Secure Development Lifecycle
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning for security vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Testing**: Runtime security testing and penetration testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability assessments
- **Security Reviews**: Mandatory security review for all code changes
- **Secure Coding Standards**: Following OWASP guidelines and best practices

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- **File Upload Security**: Virus scanning and file type validation
- **API Input Validation**: Schema validation for all API endpoints

### Session Management
- **Secure Session Tokens**: Cryptographically strong session identifiers
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after periods of inactivity
- **Concurrent Session Limits**: Prevention of multiple simultaneous sessions
- **Session Invalidation**: Proper cleanup on logout and password changes

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Security
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated deployment with security configurations
- **Security Groups**: Network-level access controls and micro-segmentation
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for cryptographic keys
- **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certified infrastructure

### Container Security
- **Image Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning for all container images
- **Runtime Security**: Monitoring for malicious container behavior
- **Secrets Management**: Secure injection of credentials and API keys
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Network Policies**: Restricted inter-container communication

### Database Security
- **Encryption**: All databases encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Database-level user permissions and audit logging
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted, geographically distributed backups
- **Connection Security**: SSL/TLS required for all database connections
- **Query Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for suspicious database activity

## Operational Security

### Vulnerability Management
- **Automated Scanning**: Weekly vulnerability scans across all systems
- **Patch Management**: Critical patches applied within 24 hours
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external security assessments
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Responsible disclosure program for security researchers
- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure process for security issues

### Incident Response
- **24/7 Monitoring**: Security Operations Center (SOC) with round-the-clock monitoring
- **Incident Classification**: Standardized severity levels and response procedures
- **Response Team**: Dedicated incident response team with defined roles
- **Communication Plan**: Clear escalation and notification procedures
- **Post-Incident Review**: Detailed analysis and process improvements

### Business Continuity
- **Disaster Recovery**: Comprehensive recovery plans with defined RTOs and RPOs
- **Data Backup**: Automated, tested backups with geographic redundancy
- **System Redundancy**: High availability architecture with failover capabilities
- **Crisis Management**: Executive-level crisis management procedures
- **Regular Testing**: Quarterly disaster recovery drills and plan validation

## Compliance & Governance

### Security Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management System certification
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual third-party security audits
- **GDPR**: Full compliance with data protection regulations
- **Industry Standards**: Adherence to sector-specific security requirements

### Security Training
- **Employee Training**: Annual security awareness training for all staff
- **Phishing Simulation**: Regular phishing tests and remedial training
- **Security Champions**: Designated security advocates in each team
- **Incident Simulation**: Tabletop exercises for incident response training

### Risk Management
- **Risk Assessments**: Regular security risk assessments and threat modeling
- **Third-Party Risk**: Vendor security assessments and ongoing monitoring
- **Security Metrics**: Key security indicators and reporting dashboards
- **Executive Reporting**: Regular security posture reports to leadership

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized collection and analysis of security logs
- **Threat Detection**: AI-powered detection of security anomalies
- **Alert Correlation**: Intelligent correlation of security events
- **Forensic Capabilities**: Detailed investigation and evidence collection
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance reporting and audit trails

### Key Security Metrics
- **Authentication Failures**: Failed login attempts and account lockouts
- **Privilege Escalations**: Unauthorized access attempts and permissions changes
- **Data Access Patterns**: Unusual data access or download activities
- **System Performance**: Resource utilization and availability metrics
- **Vulnerability Exposure**: Open vulnerabilities and remediation timelines
